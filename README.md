# Project Shutdown Notice

This project did not go as planned. I made fatal mistakes at the very start of the project and I was trying to rework them I decided to throw in the towel.

This project has taught me a lot and has brought a good amount of good into the world. Overrall, I am proud of it.

Nonetheless, it is now defunct and will at best serve as a prototype for the next interation.

A new project has been started under the name E2X which I will develop in a more open fashion when the time comes.

Farewell.

# Etudie CA!

Etudie CA is blah blah, insert generic project description here...

# Specs!

This is the fun part - the technical breakdown of the project file by file.

`/cache`: The cache holds an encrypted cache of user logins in order to accelerate post-intial connections.

`/css` and `/js`: Holds the css/js files. Statically served.

`/questions` and `/img`: No legit documentation yet.

`/routes`: Every single file in this folder is `require`'d by the engine on startup. Everything that handles any path, goes here.

`/userconfig`: A bloody mess

`/util`: Utility functions
